# Many-Agent Reinforcement Learning

This repository studies and implements the many-agent reinforcement learning algorithms from the paper:
>G. Arslan and S. YÃ¼ksel, **Decentralized Q-Learning for Stochastic Teams and Games**, *IEEE Trans. Automatic Control*, vol. 62, pp. 1545 - 1558, April 2017

- `multi_agent_learning.py`: module implementing the multi-agent Q-learning algorithm from:

- `br_graph_analysis.py`: module for learning and analyzing the best-reply graph of a game problem.

- look at the `notebooks` folder for examples using these modules (the notebooks are varied in content; at the moment this is just a dump of various experiments that are part of a research project).
