# Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Convergence to Team-Optimality


The repository includes the following:

- `multi_agent_learning.py`: module implementing the multi-agent Q-learning algorithm.

- `br_graph_analysis.py`: module for learning and analyzing the best-reply graph of a game problem.

- `team_learning.py`: module implementing decentralized team-learning algorithm.

- `sim_utils.py`: module containing some basic utility functions for running simulations.

- look at the `notebooks` folder for examples using these modules (the notebooks are varied in content; at the moment this is just a dump of various experiments that are part of the research project).
